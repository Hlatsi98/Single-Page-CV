# Single-Page-CV
This is a Single-Page CV made with only HTML. The focus is on laying out my education, skills, and career history in a clean, semantic manner. This project can be run locally using VS Code or Notepad++ and the page will appear as a Chrome or Edge page, depending on your choice of browser.
I followed instructions from https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv .
